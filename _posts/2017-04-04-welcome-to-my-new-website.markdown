Hello there! 

Welcome to my new website. I'm going to endeavor to keep a blog about my experience in my PhD, which is about mackerel collective behavior. This project is heavy in modelling and computational work (read: I've had to learn how to program) and I'd like to be a resource for anyone interested in computational ecology, but maybe isn't sure what tools are out there and how to start. I taught myself much of what I know (mostly R and Python) and though that might not be the best approach, if I can do it, sure as heck you can too.

On the side, I'm a scuba diver hoping to jump into these warm, tropical Irish waters soon. I'm also the student representative to the [Society for Conservation Biology Marine Section][SCBM] and our next conference will be in Kuching, Malaysia: [IMCC5][IMCC5].

If you're interested in marine ecology, conservation, data science, or just really like mackerel, come along with me on this journey!

Best,

-Sophia
