"Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds" 

-L.M. Montgomery, *Anne of Green Gables*

I just got back from a research trip on the [RV Celtic Voyager][RV]. I can't wait to go back.

The survey was the result of an application for ship time orchestrated by Ryan McGeady, a PhD student and Cullen Fellow at NUI Galway and the Marine Institute. The scientific team for the start of the survey (including NUIG PhD student & Cullen Fellow Catherine Jordan, Leigh Barnwall, and Darragh Furey) had an average age of 26! You can read all about our adventures on the Marine Institute's [Scientists@Sea blog][blog].

Since the science is covered in detail in those blog posts, I thought I'd focus more on my personal experience on this blog and share a few of my pictures. Since it was my first trip with on the Marine Institute's vessels, I was nervous before the trip. I was worried about being suitably prepared, whether or not I'd be any good at the work, that I'd be incapacitated by seasickness, that I wouldn't like the food.... the list goes on and on. 

But, I shouldn't have worried. I should have remembered that I **love** boats. I love being on the water, finding out how equipment works, and being part of a team. My nerves subsided when I woke up to us steaming out of Galway in the morning. Though, the couple of pints with the team the night before *might* have helped.

Before I inundate you with photos of some of the cool stuff we saw along the way, I'd just like to encourage you to embrace any adventure in your path. While you might be nervous to embark on, for example, a ship affectionately known as the "vomit comet", it can lead to some fantastic memories and future opportunities. :)
