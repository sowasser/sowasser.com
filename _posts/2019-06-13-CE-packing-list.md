I'm preparing to go on another cruise on the RV Celtic Explorer with the Irish Marine Institute. I've been on two cruises with them previously, [one on the Celtic Voyager][cv], the smaller of the two vessels, and [one on the Celtic Explorer][ce]. I'm always full of nerves and excitement before going on a cruise, but preparing always helps!

I was pretty nervous before the first time I went, and some of that anxiety was due to feeling like I wouldn't be prepared. So, to hopefully alleviate some potential stress on any other first-time survey goers, here is what I recommend bringing.

<br>

### The Essentials
The **most** important things to pack are original copies of your:

1. Passport
2. [STCW-95 Personal Survival Techniques][pst] certificate
3. Seafarer's Medical Certificate (available from a GP)

Also, if you'll be doing anything on deck, you'll need a pair of steel-toed boots and oilskins (also called bibs). I have these [Dickies boots][boots]. They're lined with cosy fleece! I also have these [Grund√©ns bibs][bibs], but the [Guy Cotten bibs][guy] are also popular. You can choose whether you prefer understated green/black, or bold yellow/orange ;). While the boots and bibs are good enough to keep you dry in the wet lab, a good waterproof jacket to go over the bibs is a good idea.


### The Comforts
* Warm clothes (can do laundry)
* Comfy clothes / pajamas
* Camera
* Binoculars
* Seasickness tablets, ginger pastilles


### The Extras
* herbal tea / snacks / hot sauce
* Hard drive of movies & tv
* Work playlist
* Cash
