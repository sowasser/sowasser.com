Today I want to tell you about what I'm going to do this summer because if I tell you, you'll hold me acountable to reaching my goals. Right? Thanks.

There's a challenge by Renee of the [Becoming A Data Scientist] blog, called the Summer of Data Science, ([#SoDS17] on Twitter ;). As she puts it, "The Summer of Data Science is a commitment to learn something this summer to enhance your data science skills, and to share what you learned." Sounds like the motivation I need, as I've been working on a proposal to filming social fish in an aquarium this winter so I can test both Bayesian analysis for model selection and using a neural network to create a new model of collective behaviour.

Unfortunately, I know very little about Bayesian statistics or neural networks.

For the former, I'm attending a course with [Highland Statistics] in Norway (!) this fall. I'll let you know how that goes. For the latter, I'm going to attempt to teach myself. I've been researching machine learning programs using [DataSciGuide.com] and I've decided to start with the [DataCamp Deep Learning in Python] course. I chose this course because of the very good things I've heard about DataCamp and because I'm thinking that deep learning (specifically neural networks) will be the best approach for me. I found [this article] explaning the differences between machine and deep learning very helpful.

I'll update this blog as I work towards my deep learning goals, including what resources I've found helpful. If you'd like to join in on the fun, check out Renee's post on the challenge here: [Summer of Data Science 2017].

Onwards!
